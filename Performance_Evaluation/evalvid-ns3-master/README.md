1 - Put this paste evalvid-ns3-master inside the folder  ns-3.29/src/
2 - Make sure that the folder "evalvid" has been correctly unpacked
3 - Move the files highway_cif.mp4 and st_highway_cif.st from evalvid-example-video paste to ns-3.29/ 
4 - ./waf configure --enable-examples
5 - Run  ./waf build
6 - Run ./waf --run "evalvid-client-server" or ./waf --run "evalvid-lte" //for test
7 - You get two files sd_a01 and rd_a01 // the sd_a01 is the file generated by server node and the rd_a01 is the file received by client node.

Have fun!!!
